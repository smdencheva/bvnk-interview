## Manual Testing

Follow these steps to verify the key user flows:

1. **Accept Quote**

    * Start the dev server: `npm run dev`.
    * Navigate to `/payin/<UUID>` (replace `<UUID>` with a valid quote ID).
    * Confirm the merchant name, display amount, and reference number appear correctly.
    * Choose a different currency from the dropdown and verify the amount due updates.
    * Click **Confirm** and ensure you're redirected to `/payin/<UUID>/pay`.

2. **Pay Quote**

    * On `/payin/<UUID>/pay`, verify:

        * The QR code renders correctly.
        * The amount due, wallet address, and countdown timer display.
        * Copy buttons for amount and address place the correct text on the clipboard.
    * Click **Cancel** and ensure you're redirected to `/payin/<UUID>/expired`.

3. **Expiry Page**

    * Navigate directly to `/payin/<UUID>/expired` where the quote is expired.
    * Verify the expired message and UI match the design.

## Architecture & Conventions
